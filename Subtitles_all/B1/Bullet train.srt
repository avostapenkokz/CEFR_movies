00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,886
-Do you still have the case?
-Yeah, I stashed it.

522
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,889
-Get off at the next stop.
-It sounds so easy when you say it.

523
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,895
Does the name El Cigarillo
mean anything to you?

524
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,566
-El Saguaro? The cartel boss?
-Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

525
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,485
He was in the wedding
you infiltrated in Mexico.

526
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,989
-Tequila?
-You were the cocktail server.

527
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,494
The groom.
I knew I recognized that guy.

528
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,705
-I'm really good with faces.
-Wait, what guy?

529
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,207
Sorry. Be right back.

530
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,584
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit. He's dead now.

531
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,087
-You killed the Wolf?
-It was an accident.

532
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,549
I'm really gonna have to process
my part in the incident on Monday.

533
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,718
Shit! Fuck! No.

534
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,137
Shit. Fuck. What?

535
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,639
Remember those two wackos from the
Bolivia job killed all those people?

536
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,225
-The Twins?
-Yeah, I'm not so sure they're twins.

537
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,144
Stop it. Everyone knows they're twins.

538
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,271
One of them is walking
towards me right now.

539
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,648
I think I saw the other
one on the platform.

540
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,649
[woman in Japanese] Occupied.

541
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,359
Now we know who
the owners of the case are.

542
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,819
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

543
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,779
We have to have a hard discussion
about the caliber of people

544
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,781
-we are surrounding ourselves with.
-Why are we whispering?

545
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,867
[cell phone buzzing]

546
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,748
-Hello.
-[man] The White Death would like to know

547
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,958
-why you stepped off train.
-Wanted some fresh air.

548
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,753
Your orders were to stay on the train.

549
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,922
I didn't realize I was gettin'
a babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

550
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,634
I'm a professional. We're making sure
the case and his son are perfectly safe.

551
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,512
-Can I please go do my job now?
-If something is go wrong...

552
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
Oh, very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

553
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,981
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

554
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,026
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train in Japan.

555
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,195
This rude enough for ya,
ya fucking prick?

556
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,239
Shove that fuckin' hat
up your fuckin' asshole, you hear me?

557
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,911
Fuck this job.

558
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,080
I knew we should have got an upgrade,
fuck all.

559
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,706
I beg your pardon, sorry.

560
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,626
I wasn't aware
there was a young lady present. Apologize.

561
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,755
You didn't happen to see someone come by
with a silver briefcase, did ya?

562
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,590
There's a little train sticker
by the handle.

563
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,551
Actually, yeah.

564
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,930
A man with black framed glasses had it.
He went that way.

565
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,768
Thank you, love.

566
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,563
That fucking bastard.

568
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,651
Come on.

"Guy in black glasses. Stop him."

571
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,662
-Hi. There's a gun under this table--
-[Lemon] Shh.

572
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,458
This is the quiet car. Gotta use
your small inside voice in here, son.

573
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,548
There's a gun underneath this table
pointed right at you, so I would--

574
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,591
-I can't really hear what you're saying.
-There's a gun--

-[shushing]
-[chuckles]

576
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm just fuckin' with you, mate.

577
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,182
It's been a long time
since Johannesburg.

578
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,435
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

579
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,147
Really. You don't remember me?

580
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,526
You look like every white homeless man
I've ever seen.

581
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,153
Okay.

582
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,656
Well, I have something
I believe you're looking f--

583
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,284
-Really? You don't remember me?
-I remember Johannesburg,

584
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,119
-but I don't remember you.
-You shot me.

585
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,581
-I shoot a lot of people.
-You shot twice.

586
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,498
Ow!

587
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
Well, you also have a shootable face.

588
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,588
I know you're Black Framed Glasses.

589
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,174
The cheeky fucker
who took our briefcase.

590
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,427
Yes. Yes, I am.

591
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,511
Hm.

592
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,890
You know, I've done a lot
of personal work since Joburg.

593
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,808
I've forgiven, I've moved on.

594
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,728
I've learned that
with any potential conflict

595
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,981
there's an opportunity for growth,
a path to a peaceful outcome.

596
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,067
[Prince] Interesting.

597
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,194
Who is that?

598
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,196
I have no idea.

599
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,281
[ominous music playing]

600
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,540
How did you know that was there?

601
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,668
Didn't I mention?

602
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,629
I've always been lucky.

603
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,552
It was then that I took
a long, hard look into the mirror.

604
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,054
And you know what?

605
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,181
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

606
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,433
Nope. Nada.

607
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,517
[Lemon] Hm.

608
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,438
-Until I did. You know?
-Mm.

609
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,569
-Between us now sits a wall.
-Mm-hm.

610
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,113
But it's an illusion.

611
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,701
For within every wall,
uh, awaits a window--

612
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,037
Oh, wait, it's a door.

613
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,165
Real quick, um, every day
is a fucking headache with you, innit?

614
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,044
Right. You and your partner--

615
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,462
I'm Lemon, he's Tangerine.

616
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,381
Okay, Lemon-- Like the fruit?

617
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,049
Blessings.

618
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,634
Mm.

619
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,386
-What's your plan here?
-Here's the plan.

620
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,846
I give you back your case,
you don't kill me.

621
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,641
You give your case to your employer,
he doesn't kill you.

622
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,769
You're alive, I'm alive,
everyone's happy.

623
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,937
Win-win, don't you think?

624
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,691
How do you know whoever hired you
won't kill you for failing your job?

625
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,401
Lose-lose. No happy.

626
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,944
Man, I just wanna get off this train,

627
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,571
go see a Zen garden
and some shit, you know?

628
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,701
-I'd like to accept your offer.
-Great.

629
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,036
But then you went and killed someone.
Didn't you?

630
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,379
-How did you know...?
-Wasn't exactly subtle.

631
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,715
It was an accident. Tragic.

632
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,841
Bizarre, even.

633
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,801
Cool story, bro,

634
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,345
but I think you had your own plans
of getting out of here with that case.

635
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,472
-No, no.
-Pinning a body on us.

636
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,473
Hoping the White Death

637
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,934
is so busy cuttin' off our arms
instead of cuttin' off our fingers.

638

It's like Thomas the Tank Engine
always says: "Simple is better."

-The kids' show?
-Yes, the fucking ki-- Man.

640
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,567
I learned everything
about people from Thomas.

641
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,860
-Everything.
-Really?

642
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,987
It's how I can read people like you
so well.

643
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,614
-And you are a Diesel.
-I am not a Diesel.

644
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,867
-You're the Diesel-est Diesel...
-Not even close.

645

out of my life, you know?

If there was a gun under this table, yeah,
I'd be as dead as that kid over there.

it's the son of the White Death.

00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:38,389
The kid was poisoned in the same way
as El Sbarro was at the wedding.

690
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,057
It's El Saguaro.

691
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,517
-The same killer?
-Yeah.

692
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,271
I'm like MacGyver.

693
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,191
Fuck!

694
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,195
[news fanfare playing]

695
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,910
[in Japanese] All of Japan is in terror
because a poisonous snake was stolen.

696
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,331
[handler] Boomslang snakes
have a very strong poison.

697
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,042
When they bite,
it can cause internal bleeding...

698
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,461
and bleeding from holes in the body.

699
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,754
Oh, shit.

700
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,047
[Maria] What are you doing?

701
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,009
What's wrong?

702
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,218
Fuck this, man.

703
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,304
Fuck Carver.

704
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,308
Shit.

705
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,728
-Oh, thank God. For a minute there....
-[groans]

706
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,980
Jesus Christ,
you had a bit of a bosh, pal.

707
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,401
All right. Five stations to Kyoto.

708
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,361
Better get tickety-boo.

709
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,909
Would you describe me
as someone who lives in perpetual anxiety?

710
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,036
No, no.

711
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,120
Ah, fucknuts.

712
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,913
And if it wasn't clear, I meant "yes."

713
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,042
-The conductor, I don't have a ticket.
-Not sure that's your biggest concern.

714
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,169
You don't understand,
this guy's like Criss-fuckin'-Angel.

715
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,754
He pops up everywhere.

716
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,798
He slows me down,
Tangerine catches me, I am dead.

717
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,009
Dead. Dead.

718
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,887
Hold on.

719
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,809
Hey, bro.

720
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,313
Wanna make an easy 200 bucks?

721
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,153
Is this like a...sex thing?

722
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,158
Nope.

723
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,369
Oh, okay. I was kidding.

724
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,120
Uh, yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?

725
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,768
[toy squeaks]

726
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,122
All right, game's up, big boy.

727
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,207
Where is the case?

728
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,210
Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough--

729
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,547
Whoa, whoa, um, is this the sex stuff?

730
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,674
[firecrackers exploding]

731
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,093
Twat!

732
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,513
-Shit.
-I do love an accent.

733
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,014
[passengers chattering]

734
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,729
Come on.

735
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,155
Oops.

736
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,950
Picture it.

737
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,952
Picture what?

738
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,204
Well, the man. Watching your son.

739
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,207
I wonder how he'll do it.

740
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,211
Maybe a pillow to the face.

741
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,422
Or maybe something clever.

742
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,175
Like an air bubble in the IV.

743
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,260
[ominous music playing]

744
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,013
No, no. You hold onto it.

745
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,932
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

746
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,642
if you're holding a loaded gun.

747
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,727
[cell phone buzzing]

748
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,150
Put it on speaker.

749
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,695
-[in Japanese] Father.
-Yuichi?

750
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,948
Why did you leave the hospital?

751
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,993
Be honest.

752
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,662
Who's there with you?

753
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,585
I found out who pushed Wataru
off that roof.

754
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,129
Did you go to the authorities?

755
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,924
I wanted to handle it myself.

756
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,012
My son.

757
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,265
You can't control
what fate has in store for us.

758
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,808
Father.

759
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,019
I'm sorry.

760
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,190
We're not finished.

761
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,985
You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination

762
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,654
until you open up that case.

763
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,865
-[in English] Kid, that could take f--
-No, no. It won't.

764
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,910
I'd start with the low numbers.
Just a thought.

765
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,958
[dramatic music playing]

766
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,467
[grunts]

767
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,135
[grunts] Fuck me!

768
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,639
-There he is.
-He got by me.

769
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,349
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

770
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,561
I guess our best option now

771
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,313
is, uh, bring the White Death
the man who killed his son.

772
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,399
-But Glasses didn't do it.
-I could give a rat's ass.

773
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,359
No, I'm telling you, I read him.
He's not the type, mate.

774
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,111
I'll tell you what, do you like your arms?

775
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,362
-You know I like my arms.
-Well, then

776
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,447
someone's got to take the blame,
don't they?

777
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,532
[cell phone buzzes]

778
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,159
-That's you or me?
-You or me?

779
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,122
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

780
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,248
And my gun, Lucille.

781
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,542
-Oh, come on.
-That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.

782
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,626
Fuck about.

783
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,005
-Right, what?
-[man] Step off the train at the next stop

784
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,465
-with the briefcase and the son.
-Hang on a minute, didn't we say Kyoto?

785
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,925
You will still depart at Kyoto.

786
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,678
The White Death wants to make sure
you are being honest about situation.

787

-Well, this is a complete waste of our t--
-[call disconnects]

788
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,809
All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have

789
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,061
and a live son instead of a dead one.

790

[pensive music playing]

791
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,814
What are you thinking?

["Kill Me Pretty" playing]

794
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,154
You were all told to exit the train.

795
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,990
Yeah? Well, unlike you,
I'm a professional.

796
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,701
I wanted to make sure it weren't
some Yakuza trap, but clearly not.

797
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,662
It's some fuckin' '80s dance-off, innit?

798
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,165
Where is your twin? Tangerine?

799
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,249
I'm Tangerine.

Lemon's keepin' the case safe.

801
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,836
And the White Death's son?

802
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,255
Yeah, he's there.

803
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,677
Wave to your fuckin' fans, princess.

804
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,389
He's a fuckin' happy chappy, isn't he?

805
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,892
But, uh, I've gotta pop on the train,
you know, ten seconds left, so ta-ra.

806
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,562
We'll stick to the plan,
depart in Kyoto.

807
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,066
Do us a favor:
Get the fuck off my back, will ya?

808
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,368
Okay.

809
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,329
Okay.

Whoa!

Okay.

Okay.

-That couldn't have gone better.
-Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

We need to find that Glasses twat,

double back when you're done.

fucking deal with him, yeah?

Yeah.

-Up is...?
-That way. Towards Tokyo.

are always moving down.

820

and come up with the answers later.

840
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,507
Yeah. Have you tried
these smart toilets?

841
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,051
They're a pleasure to the senses.

842
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,888
If I had one in the chamber
I would rock this bad boy right now.

843
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,015

Oh, look at that.

[tense music playing]

853
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,351
What the fuck are you doing?

854
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,188
I am doing the same thing
that I did to the gun in your hand.

855
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,820
I'm just making things interesting.

856

I'm hedging my bets, you could say.

the case will.

This thing could have
blown up in my hand at any point.

860

No, no. It's inert unless you fire it.

861
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,627
But don't fire it,
you know what I mean?

862
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,298
Unlike what I put in this briefcase here.
This is very....

00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,719
Well, this is not inert at all.
This is....

864
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,012
[Kimura groans]

865
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:50,226
Did you know that there have been
31 attempts on the White Death's life

866
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,187
from within his own organization?

867
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,232
Each one,
he executed with their own weapon.

868
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,194
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

869
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,864
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

870
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,951
You push my son off a roof...

871
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,078
-Right.
-...bring me to this train...

872
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,664
frame me as an assassin

873
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,334
here to kill the White Death,
and use my gun...

874
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,504
that will blow up in his face?

875
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,005
Very good.

876
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,508
Very, very good.

877
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,385
It's a stupid plan.

878
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,387
It is...

879
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,223
a brilliant plan.

880
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,644
-[chimes]
-[woman speaks in Japanese on recording]

881
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,605
[knocking on door]

882
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,023
Occupied.

883
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,236
[Maria] You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid-heart operation?

884
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,906
-Yeah, he had a stroke, right?
-No, that was the official cover.

885
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,701
He was poisoned. The assassin
goes by the name of the Hornet.

886
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,161
[screaming] Oh, my God!

887
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,749
[Maria] He used boomslang snake venom.

888
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,128
It congeals the blood,
making you bleed out of every orifice.

889
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,256
If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you're dead.

890
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,718
Fun fact:
The same poison that was used on--

891
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,760
El Sagardo.

892
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,513
[Maria] It's El Saguaro.

893
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,765
What is the Hornet doing on this train?

894
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,394
Well, whatever deal was made, it wasn't
done through the normal channels.

895
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,021
There's something else going on here.

896
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,647
[woman in Japanese]
How long are you going to be?

897
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,940
It's still occupied, lady.

898
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,402
&amp;$#%*

899
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,446
The Wolf must have
figured out who the Hornet is,

900
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,116
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss, came here to whack the Hornet.

901
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,826
Oh, my God, did you just say "whack"?

902
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,495
-I did, I'm bringing it back.
-No, it needs to stay where it was.

903
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,080
If I can figure out who the Hornet is,

904
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,916
I can give him to Lemon and Tangerine
so they don't whack me.

905
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,127
-Really?
-You see what I did there?

906
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,879
You're really proud of yourself,
aren't you?

907
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:44,299
-[knocking on door]
-Jeez, they're usually so polite here.

908
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,342
Lady, I'm so--

909
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,178
[beeping]

910
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,346
Oh. That's cool.

911
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,267
Bastard!

912
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,352
[lively rock music playing]

913
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,190
Come here, you dirty fucking scum!

914
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,716
Wait, wait, wait.
I know who killed the kid.

915
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,469
I couldn't give a rat's ass.
Where's my fucking case?

916
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,436
[music stops]

917
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,440
[speaks in Japanese]

918
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,441
Yeah.

919
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:48,905
Oh.

920
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,620
-[speaking in Japanese]
-Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

921
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,089
-[speaking in Japanese]
-Oh, no, thank you. We're okay.

922
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,008
Oh, I would love a bottle of water.

923
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,886
[speaking in Japanese]

924
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,932
You know what? Do you have
anything sparkling? With bubbles?

925
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,771
That's the one. Thank--

926
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,273
[both speak in Japanese]

927
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,524
Yeah.

928
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,525
Oh, yeah.

929
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:31,239
Bro, I just remembered I gave all my money
to that guy to wear my hat and glasses.

930
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,657
Could you?

931
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,374
How much for the bottle of water, love?

932
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,918
-[speaks in Japanese]
-[Ladybug] Ah!

933
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,672
Oh, there. No, you're welcome. Yeah.

934
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,050
A thousand yen. That's ten quid
for that bottle of water, mate.

935
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,343
[Ladybug] Mmm.

936
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,013
-[speaking in Japanese]
-Ta-ra.

937
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:56,890
[speaks in Japanese]

938
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,314
[in English]
You sure you don't wanna talk this out?

939
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,107
Not particularly, no.

940
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,275
Okay.

941
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,904
[lively rock music continues]

942
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,115
You fucking bastard!
Fucker! Come here, you little fuck!

943
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,046
I know who killed the kid.

944
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,006
Yeah? Where the fuck is he, then?

945
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,550
He's on this train.

946
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,594
Well, that narrows it down,
then, don't it?

947
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,392
Let go! Get off!

948
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,461
[cell phone buzzing]

949
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,838
You gonna get that?

950
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,882
No.

951
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,593
You probably oughta get that.

952
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,516
It could be important.

953
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,145
Okay, maybe it's important.

954
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,147
Fucking hell. Come here.

955
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,567
Yeah, what do you want?

956
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,152
The White Death says to get off
at next stop holding the briefcase

957
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,988
or he will kill everyone on that train.

958
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,866
Okay, yeah, I can make it, but Lemon,
he's a little tied up right now.

959
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:43,079
Both of you this time. With the case.
Or everyone dies.

960
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,333
Fuckin' paranoid, this lot.

961
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,918
You don't happen to have the case
on you, do ya?

962
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,086
No.

963
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,799
Yeah, I don't think
I'd reach Lemon in time anyway.

964
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,593
You still got his phone.

965
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,344
Do you have a gun on ya?

966
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,182
-Don't like 'em.
-Well....

967
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,144
Game's up, mate.

968
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,563
For what it's worth,
you seem like a right fucking asshole

969
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,732
and I'm glad
you're gonna fucking die with me.

970
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,858
That's nice.

971
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,402
[groans]

972
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,446
-Just curious.
-Yeah?

973
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,990
Do they even know
what Lemon looks like?

974
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,825
Wow.

975
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,245
You two do look like twins, huh?

976
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,164
[ominous music playing]

977
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,541
Yeah, okay. We got the case, now what?

978
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,085
You still take the train to Kyoto Station.

979
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,881
Mm-hm. Yeah. Okay.
We can do that. Wonderful.

980
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:35,840
[Gunhand] Hey.

981
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,260
-Have you opened the case?
-[Tangerine] No, of course not.

982
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,471
I never asked for the combination,
you know what I mean?

983
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,680
Keep it safe that way.

984
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,057
[Ladybug in British accent] Yeah.

985
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,767
So no one gets greedy.

986
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:06,788
[in normal voice] I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

987
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,457
-I have this bad luck thing.
-Is that what you call it?

988
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,917
I hit the thing and it went:

989
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,420
-Why did you even bother trying?
-I was trying to sell it.

990
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,922
Well, I don't think
they were in the market

991
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,299
for fucking dildos and pantyhose,
were they?

992
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,967
But they were buying it.

993
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,886
I had 'em.

994
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,767
[Kimura] You proved you're smarter
than everyone. You've won, kid.

995
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,686
Please.

996
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,647
Please, kid.

997
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,108
Call your man.

998
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,194
I'll do what you want.

999
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,447
Just leave my son alone.

1000
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,908
Your son.

1001
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,955
Do you know how easy it was
to get him to follow me up onto that roof?

1002
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,167
Didn't think
it would take you three hours

1003
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,879
to even realize your son was missing.

1004
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,132
You're a terrible father,

1005
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,718
and your son is going to pay

1006
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,761
for all the mistakes that you've made.

1007
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,057
You don't know anything about life.

1008
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,144
How hard it is.

1009
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,771
You're just...

1010
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,982
some spoiled girl

1011
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,192
who breaks their toys

1012
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,070
when Mommy says she has to pick up.

1013
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:26,367
Sorry. Pardon me, I don't mean
to interrupt what's, uh, going on here.

1014
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,119
But you wouldn't happen to have seen

1015
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,205
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

1016
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,418
No.

1017
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,463
What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?

1018
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,256
It's not ringing any--

1019
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,885
Uncle Kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train--

1020
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,262
Did you say
"train sticker by the handle"?

1021
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,181
-The handle had a train sticker.
-That's unique.

1022
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,850
No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.

1023
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:51,934
[Lemon] Hm.

1024
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,103
"Uncle Kimura"?

1025
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,607
-Yeah.
-Right. Are you okay? That's....

1026
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,610
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

1027
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:04,405
Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.

1028
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,115
Pardon me, "Uncle Kimura."

1029
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,366
You guys take care.

1030
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,285
Just one thing, though, uh....

1031
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,332
Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,

1032
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,625
overnight and all.

1033
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,335
But you....

1034

-You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.
-Mm-hm.

1039

We should just get off this train. Now.

1040

without Lemon or the case,

1041
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,276
you must be mistaken.

1042
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,821
Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.

1043
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:48,157
It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.

Me, I'm getting off.

1045
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,370

and reevaluate my choices or something.

1046

but here's the deal.

1047

-Yeah.

No, I understand. I get it.

1051
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,635
It's a bit of a conundrum,
'cause I'm thinking,

1052

"Do I hand him back in one piece"

1053
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,682
or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking Momomon.

1054
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,725
That's what's
going through my head right now.

1055

You know, before us now is just a wall,

1059
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,735
but it's an illusion, man,
it's a construct.

1060
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,488
You know,
'cause within that wall sits a window.

1061
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,115

Which one is the Diesel,
which one is the Duck?

1070
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,310

1075

to hold me for ransom.

1078
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:19,206
Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,

1079
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,875
but I'm really good at reading people

1080
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,502
and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.

1081
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:30,885
So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

1082
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,888
Then I get no answers.

1083

We're gonna play a little game.

Perfect. I knew you would like this.

1086
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,191
You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

1087
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,401
Whichever one is in charge,
raise your hand.

1088
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,445
Whichever one isn't,
you point at the one who is.

1089
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,989
Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

1090
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,908
I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.

1091
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,868
And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

1092
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,996
You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.

1554
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:38,519
[in English] I came to see you.

1555
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:40,563
Hm.

1556
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:43,107
And to make you finally see me.

1557
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,569

1558
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,321
Hm.

1559
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:53,117
I built myself up
from the nothing you gave me.

01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,036
All so I could be
the one in front of you today...

1562
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:02,418
I was the one...

1563
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,462
...who deserved your attention.

1564
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:10,843
Your love.

[in English] Do it.

1568
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,658
I came here to kill you.

1569
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,412
So kill me.

1570
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,500

1572

1578

But you have never been part of my plan.

1579
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,011
We found the American!

1580
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:40,474
[in English] What about the others?

1581
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:41,892
They're all dead.

Time for you to start up--

1588

Oh, shit. Everything's in Japanese.

1589
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:06,542
There is no episode in Japanese.

Get on the ground!

Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.

Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?

1594

Just open the goddamn case.

Uh, Mr. Death, if I may?

The shadow buyer

1598

got us all on this train.

[both] Oh!

1602
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,790
That was you, right?

1603
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:50,085
[in English] Yes, very astute.

1604
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,963
I brought you on this train
hoping you'd kill each other.

1605
01:40:53,046 --> 01:40:54,631
Okay. Well, um....

1606

If I could.... Why?

1607
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,054
Why you do what you do?

1608

You know, I've been
asking that very question.

If it's so safe,
why didn't he just open it?

What if it's a bomb
and it blows up in our faces?

Let me relieve you of both.

My wife...

1617
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,086
was taken from me.

1618
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:40,886

It was a horrible accident.

-Horrible.
-Oh, no.

1620
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:48,393
No. Nothing in life is an accident.

1621
01:41:48,977 --> 01:41:51,939
It was an assassination attempt on me.

1622
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:52,898
But fate....

1623
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,278
Fate put two wet work operatives,

1624

twins, on a job in Bolivia,

1625
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,745
butchering my entire crew.

1626
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,581
And I had to go deal with it.

1627
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:12,084
And he didn't hire
two random operators, Lemon.

1628
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,545
No, he asked for the two
responsible for the Bolivia job.

1629
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:19,758
That is why it was my wife
in the car that night,

1630
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:21,301
not me.

1631
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:24,888
Fate put my wife in the hospital.

we would ever bail him out of trouble.
